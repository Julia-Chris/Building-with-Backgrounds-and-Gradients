# Building-with-Backgrounds-and-Gradients

It is the fourth project in HTML/CSS Microverse Main curriculum course. The main objective is to clone an old Apple website using back-ground and gradients. The webpage is divided into three parts (Top, Middle and Footer), which are then enclosed within a Page Wrapper.
The Top part consists of a nav bar created with a list of links, two icons and an input. It also contains a header, with images used to present a heading and some introductory text. Similar to the Top, the Middle is built with a list of fours links used to display four linked images. Finally, the Bottom/Footer contains small prints, structured with a couple of paragraphs, and a list of footer links.

Project Features
The project has been broken down into four major parts:

The Main Wrapper

Nav-bar

Footer

The whole page has been laid out using CSS Flex-box and partly floats. The Nav-bar has been styled using flex which helps in alignment and positioning. A backgroung image is also applied to the top and also within the Nav-bar so that it can be adjusted through setting a border to it.
